## Introduction
This project's goal is to build a 2-DOF ball and plate system, which can balance a ping-pong ball on a flat plate.

To detect the position of the ball, We use a low-cost USB camera as the image sensor, and process the video in real time with OpenCV-Python on the PC.The coordinate is then transmitted to STM32 microcontroller where a noise-immune PD control loop is implemented, actuating 2 servos to control the pitch and roll of the plate to keep the ball in its centre.To reduce the oscillation caused by large noises, a noise-robust differentiator[1] is used to improved the PD control algorithm. Experiment results show that the system using this method has better robustness and rapidness.
